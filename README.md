### SkateDice

App made for skateboarders to play games of skate with. These games are played at the skatepark. Rules and information can be found [over here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Skate).

This app gives you random tricks based on a difficulty level you can pick. The idea is based on The Berrics's [Skate Or Dice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMad6sMxzko).
